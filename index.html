Being assigned to work on the same team, we worked closely together from ideation to completion on a number of projects. Ryan is focused and driven to provide the best final product possible using the tools provided. When we found gaps in our capabilities, Ryan was the driver in finding smart solutions. He uses strong research skills and tenacity to find a workaround to any blockers we would encounter. He takes the initiative to work with other teams to create new tools and processes that would help us both short and long-term. Ryan persistently strives for excellence in his work and it is contagious to those he works with - myself included. I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for someone that will go above and beyond.</p>
